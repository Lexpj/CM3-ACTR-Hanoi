# CM3-ACTR-Hanoi
Third assignment for cognitive modelling: perform Hanoi via ACT-R

## Setup
Cloning this repo is enough for the setup. This code runs on Python 2.7, so your usual IDE might say that the syntax is not right. However, running it via a Python shell running Python version 2.7 does the job.
To check your Python version, run 
```bash
python -V
```
in your terminal. Or, if you are in a Python shell, run
```python
import sys
sys.version
```

## Code
The code can be run with and without logging. Logging will also print every action taken by the ACT-R environment, like setting goals and chunks.
Without logging, the code will still print at each iteration what disks are on what pegs and what move has been made (disk X to peg Y).
